		/// The File adapter transfers files into and out of Microsoft BizTalk Server.
		/// </summary>
		/// <remarks>
		/// <para>
		/// Use the File receive adapter to read messages from files, and submit them to the server. The receive adapter reads
		/// the file, and creates a BizTalk Message object, so that BizTalk Server can process the message. While reading from
		/// the file, the adapter locks the file to ensure that no modifications can be made to the file content
		/// </para>
		/// <para>
		/// The File receive adapter reads the messages from files on local file systems or on network shares. When the specified
		/// location on a network share is unavailable due to network problems, the receive adapter retries the read operation
		/// (the number of retries is configurable in the BizTalk Server Administration console). After the message has been read
		/// and successfully accepted by the BizTalk Messaging Engine, the receive adapter deletes the file from the file system
		/// or network share. If the message was read but the pipeline did not successfully process the message, the adapter puts
		/// the message in the suspended queue and then deletes the file from the file system or network share. If the File
		/// receive adapter cannot submit or suspend the message to the MessageBox database, it does not delete the original file
		/// from the file system or network share.
		/// </para>
		/// <para>
		/// You can also configure the File receive adapter to rename files when processing them. You should rename files to
		/// ensure that the receive adapter does not generate duplicate messages if the receive location is shut down and
		/// restarted. This is a configurable option for File receive locations. By default, renaming is disabled. When renaming
		/// is enabled, the File receive adapter appends the extension .BTS-WIP to the file. The receive adapter then reads the
		/// messages from the renamed file in the receive location and submits it to the server. After the receive adapter has
		/// successfully submitted a file, the receive adapter deletes the renamed file from the file system or network share. If
		/// a message has been read but failed processing in the pipeline, the receive adapter places the message in the
		/// MessageBox database suspended queue, and deletes the renamed file from the network share.
		/// </para>
		/// <para>
		/// If the File receive adapter successfully reads the message but did not successfully store the message in the
		/// MessageBox database, the renamed file reverts to its original name, without the .BTS-WIP extension. Note that the
		/// receive adapter does not read files with the extension .BTS-WIP if the renaming option is turned on.
		/// </para>
		/// <para>
		/// <b>Using file change notifications and polling</b>
		/// </para>
		/// <para>
		/// The File receive adapter relies on Windows File Change Notifications to determine when to pick up a file from the
		/// specified directory or share. If the File receive adapter receives a Windows File Change Notification before the file
		/// has been completely written to the specified directory or share then the file will be locked and the File receive
		/// adapter will not retrieve the file. In this scenario, the File receive adapter will actively poll the specified
		/// directory or share at the Polling interval (ms) specified on the Advanced settings dialog box available when
		/// configuring a File receive location. When the File receive adapter polls a directory or share it retrieves unlocked
		/// files from the share and submits the files to the MessageBox database.
		/// </para>
		/// <para>
		/// <b>File Receive Adapter Batching Support</b>
		/// </para>
		/// <para>
		/// The File receive adapter submits messages to the server in batches. The File receive adapter starts by building a
		/// single batch per receive location by collecting all the readable files available in the receive location. Batches are
		/// submitted to the MessageBox database by the receive adapter when all the available files have been collected or when
		/// the amount of files collected exceeds the maximum batch size.
		/// </para>
		/// <para>
		/// After all the messages within the batch have been successfully read and submitted into the MessageBox database, the
		/// File receive adapter deletes the corresponding files from the receive location. If some of the messages within the
		/// batch failed processing, the File receive adapter suspends them and deletes the corresponding files from the receive
		/// location. If some or all of the messages fail to be stored in the MessageBox database, the entire batch operation is
		/// rolled back and all corresponding files are left unchanged in the receive location.
		/// </para>
